# ML-Model-Selection

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building, tuning, and evaluating a Logistic Regression model on Airbnb house listings data. It walks through data preparation, hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, model evaluation using ROC, AUC, precision-recall curves, and compares models trained with default vs. optimized hyperparameters.
